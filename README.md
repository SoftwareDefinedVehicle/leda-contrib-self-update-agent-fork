# SDV Self Update Agent
The self update agent (SUA) is a component responsible for the OS Update process. 
SUA is communicating on MQTT interface via usage of defined messages. Internally, SUA uses [RAUC](https://rauc.io/) to perform the update. 

Following sequence diagram shows the happy path example of communication between components. 

```mermaid

    participant m as MQTT Broker 
    participant s as SUA
    participant r as RAUC
    s -->> m: connect
    loop Wait for message: selfupdate/desiredstate
    Note left of s: Initial start
    s ->> m: selfupdate/currentstate
    Note left of s: Trigger for OTA
    m ->> s: selfupdate/desiredstate
    s ->> m: selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback: downloading 0%
    s ->> s: download bundle
    s ->> m: selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback: downloading 51%
    s ->> r: install
    s ->> m: selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback: installing 0%
    r ->> r: install
    r ->> s: share progress: e.g. 51%
    s ->> m: selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback: installing 51%
    r ->> s: installation ready
    s ->> m: selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback: installed 
    s ->> m: selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback: idle 
    end
```

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    Uninitialized --> Connected: Connected
    Connected --> Downloading: Start
    Downloading --> Installing: Bundle version OK
    Installing --> Installed: Install complete
    Installing --> Failed: RAUC write failed
    Downloading --> Failed: Version mismatch/download failed
    Installed --> Idle
    Failed --> Idle
```
Important: Uninitialized state is the default entry state or state in case connection is lost. To simplify reading of the diagram arrows from other states to Unitialized have been removed.

MQTT communication is done via 3 MQTT topics:

## selfupdate/desiredstate
| Topic | Direction | Description |
|-------|  -------- | ----------- |
| selfupdate/desiredstate | IN | This message triggers the update process. The payload shall contain all data necessary to obtain the update bundle and to install it. |

## selfupdate/currentstate
| Topic| Direction | Description |
|------|  -------- | ----------- |
| selfupdate/currentstate | OUT | This message is being sent once, on SUA start. It contains information about currently installed OS version.

## selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback
| Topic| Direction | Description |
|------|  -------- | ----------- |
| selfupdate/desiredstatefeedback | OUT | This message is being sent by SUA to share current progress of triggered update process. This is the *OUT* counterpart of *selfupdate/desiredstate* input message. 

SUA supports 2 protocols depending on configuration: [link](docs/k8s.md) for Kubernetes-based Custom Objects or [link](docs/bfb.md) for Update Agent API.Default protocol is bfb.

# Checkout
SUA links to some 3rd party libraries, which are fetched as submodules, therefore the cloning shall be performed with recursive option:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eclipse-leda/leda-contrib-self-update-agent.git
```
or if was cloned non recursively
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
